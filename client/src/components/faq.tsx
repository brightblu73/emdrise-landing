      question: "What is EMDRise?",

It is designed for individuals looking for accessible tools to support their emotional healing, mental health, and self-guided therapy journey."

    {
      question: "Is EMDRise a replacement for therapy with a clinician?",

    },
    {
      question: "Who created EMDRise?",

    },
    {
      question: "What if I can't finish a session?",

    },
    {
      question: "What if I feel overwhelmed during a session?",
