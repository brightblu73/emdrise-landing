            "As a Consultant Psychiatrist in the NHS, I think the EMDRise app is a really helpful tool for people living with trauma. It is slick and easy to use. Also it gives patients something practical they can engage with outside of sessions. For those with complex PTSD and other trauma-related difficulties, having this kind of support at their fingertips can make a real difference and is a much-needed resource."
