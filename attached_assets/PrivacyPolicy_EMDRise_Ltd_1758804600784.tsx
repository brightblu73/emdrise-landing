4. How We Use Your Information
We use the information we collect to provide and improve EMDRise, including to create and manage your account, deliver sessions, manage your pause and resume flow, and ensure that you can access the content offline. We process subscriptions and billing, communicate with you about your account, send important service notifications and customer support messages, and may send newsletters or promotional emails, which you can opt out of at any time. We analyse usage and performance to improve our services and develop new features, using aggregated and anonymised data where possible. We detect, prevent and respond to fraud, abuse, security incidents and legal demands, and comply with our legal obligations and enforce our agreements.
5. Legal Basis for Processing

6. AI & Data Analytics
EMDRise may integrate AI features to enhance session guidance. If enabled, these features may process your session data to provide personalised recommendations.

We do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties. We may share information with service providers who perform services on our behalf, such as hosting, authentication, video streaming, analytics, payment processing and customer support. These providers are authorised to use your information only as necessary to provide services to us. We may share information with law enforcement or government agencies when required by law, legal process or to protect the rights, property or safety of ourselves or others; with third parties in connection with a corporate transaction where user information may be transferred as part of the assets; and with researchers and developers, but only with aggregated, de‑identified data.
