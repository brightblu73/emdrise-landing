    <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
    <h2>Last updated: 7 September 2025</h2>
    <h3>1. Introduction & Acceptance</h3>
    <p>These Terms of Use ("Terms") constitute a legally binding agreement between you and GC Psychotherapy (we, us, our), a company registered in the United Kingdom, governing your access and use of EMDRise — our mobile and web application offering self‑guided EMDR therapy sessions. By accessing or using our services, you confirm that you are at least 18 years old or of legal age in your jurisdiction and that you have read, understood, and agree to these Terms and to our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, you must not use our services.</p>
    <h3>2. Eligibility & Age Restrictions</h3>
    <p>You must be at least 18 years old (or older if required by the laws of your jurisdiction) to use EMDRise. If you are under 18, your parent or guardian must consent to your use. We do not knowingly collect data from children under 16. If we discover that a minor has provided us with personal data, we will delete that data.</p>
    <h3>3. Description of the Services</h3>
    <p>EMDRise provides guided Eye Movement Desensitisation and Reprocessing (EMDR) sessions via professionally recorded videos, bilateral stimulation (visual, auditory, haptic) and intelligent session management that allows you to pause and resume. The application follows the standard ten‑phase EMDR protocol and offers a choice of virtual therapists. Our services are delivered for general informational and self‑help purposes only. They are not a substitute for professional mental health diagnosis or treatment.</p>
    <h3>4. Medical Disclaimer</h3>
    <p>EMDRise does not provide medical or mental health advice and is not intended for the provision of clinical diagnosis or for use in emergencies. The application is not designed for situations where your life or safety or that of others is at immediate risk; if you are thinking of suicide, considering harming yourself or others, or experiencing a medical emergency, you must immediately contact emergency services in your local area. You should never disregard the advice of a qualified healthcare professional because of something you learned from our services. If you have any concerns about whether our program is appropriate for you, you must consult a licensed mental health professional.</p>
    <h3>5. Account Registration & Subscription</h3>

      To access certain features of EMDRise, you must create an account and maintain an active
      subscription. By creating an account, you agree to provide accurate and complete
      information and to maintain the confidentiality of your login credentials.

    <p>
      <strong>Billing and Renewal.</strong> Your subscription will continue and automatically renew
      unless canceled. You consent to our charging your payment method on a recurring basis
      without requiring your prior approval for each recurring charge, until such time as you

      subscription plan you choose when you subscribed to the Services.

    <p>
      <strong>Free Trial.</strong> We may offer a free trial to new users who register. Unless

      and subscription pricing are displayed at the time of sign-up.

You may not modify, reverse engineer, copy, sell, or distribute any part of the application or its content. You may not use EMDRise to post or transmit unlawful, harmful, abusive or infringing content, or to interfere with the operation of our systems.

    <h3>8. AI Features & Future Development</h3>
    <p>EMDRise may incorporate artificial intelligence features in future releases to personalise your experience. Such features will not provide clinical diagnoses or decisions.

We will update our Privacy Policy to describe any new data processing and obtain your consent where required.</p>
    <h3>9. Third‑Party Services & External Links</h3>
    <p>Our services rely on third‑party providers for hosting (Supabase, Neon), authentication (Supabase Authentication), payment processing (RevenueCat and Apple), and video streaming. These services have their own terms and privacy policies.

    <p>EMDRise is provided “as is” without any warranties, expressed or implied. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we expressly disclaim all warranties, including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non‑infringement. Your use of the application is at your own risk. We do not warrant that EMDRise will meet your requirements or that the service will be uninterrupted, timely, or error‑free. In no event shall GC Psychotherapy, its directors, employees, or suppliers be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising from your use or inability to use EMDRise, including damages related to loss of data or profits. Our total liability to you for all claims will not exceed the amount you have paid us in subscription fees in the preceding three months.</p>
    <h3>11. Indemnification</h3>
    <p>You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless GC Psychotherapy and its affiliates, directors, employees and agents from any claims, damages, liabilities, and expenses arising out of or related to your use of EMDRise, your violation of these Terms, or your infringement of any rights of another.</p>
