Terms of Use
Last updated: 22 September 2025
1. Introduction & Acceptance
These Terms of Use ("Terms") constitute a legally binding agreement between you and EMDRISE Ltd, a private limited company incorporated in England and Wales with company registration number 16733416 and registered office at 20 Wenlock Road, London, N1 7GU (we, us, our), a company registered in the United Kingdom, governing your access and use of EMDRise — our mobile and web application offering self‑guided EMDR therapy sessions. By accessing or using our services, you confirm that you are at least 18 years old or of legal age in your jurisdiction and that you have read, understood, and agree to these Terms and to our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, you must not use our services.
2. Eligibility & Age Restrictions
You must be at least 18 years old (or older if required by the laws of your jurisdiction) to use EMDRise. If you are under 18, your parent or guardian must consent to your use. We do not knowingly collect data from children under 16. If we discover that a minor has provided us with personal data, we will delete that data.
3. Description of the Services
EMDRise provides guided Eye Movement Desensitisation and Reprocessing (EMDR) sessions via professionally recorded videos, bilateral stimulation (visual, auditory, haptic) and intelligent session management that allows you to pause and resume. The application follows the standard eight-phase EMDR protocol and offers a choice of virtual therapists. Our services are delivered for general informational and self‑help purposes only. They are not a substitute for professional mental health diagnosis or treatment.
4. Medical Disclaimer
EMDRise does not provide medical or mental health advice and is not intended for the provision of clinical diagnosis or for use in emergencies. The application is not designed for situations where your life or safety or that of others is at immediate risk; if you are thinking of suicide, considering harming yourself or others, or experiencing a medical emergency, you must immediately contact emergency services in your local area. You should never disregard the advice of a qualified healthcare professional because of something you learned from our services. If you have any concerns about whether our program is appropriate for you, you must consult a licensed mental health professional.
5. Account Registration & Subscription
To access certain features of EMDRise, you must create an account and maintain an active subscription. By creating an account, you agree to provide accurate and complete information and maintain the confidentiality of your login credentials.
Billing and Renewal:
Your subscription will continue and automatically renew unless canceled. You consent to our charging your payment method on a recurring basis without requiring your prior approval for each recurring charge, until such time as you cancel the applicable order. The length of your billing cycle will depend on the type of subscription plan you choose when you subscribed to the Services.
Free Trial:
We may offer a free trial to new users who register. Unless canceled before the end of the free trial period, your account will be charged according to the subscription plan you selected when you registered. The length of the free trial and subscription pricing are displayed at the time of sign-up.
