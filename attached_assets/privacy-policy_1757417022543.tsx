    <h3>4. How We Use Your Information</h3>
    <p>We use the information we collect to provide and improve EMDRise, including to create and manage your account, deliver sessions, manage your pause and resume flow, and ensure that you can access the content offline. We process subscriptions and billing, communicate with you about your account, send important service notifications and customer support messages, and may send newsletters or promotional emails, which you can opt out of at any time. We analyse usage and performance to improve our services and develop new features, using aggregated and anonymised data where possible.
