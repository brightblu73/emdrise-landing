Replace the current “How EMDRise Works” section in index.html (currently 3 generic cards) with a new grid of 10 cards that reflect the EMDRise app flow (Scripts 1–10).

REQUIREMENTS
1. Keep the heading: <h2>How EMDRise Works</h2>.
2. Use a responsive grid layout:
   - Desktop: 2 columns x 5 rows (10 cards total).
   - Mobile: stack into a single column.
3. Each card must match the style of existing cards (rounded corners, subtle shadow, consistent spacing, font, colours).
4. Add an icon to each card using the Lucide icon set (https://lucide.dev/icons/). 
   - For each card, choose a Lucide icon that best symbolises the step (for example: sunrise, home, target, waves, repeat, sparkles, shield-check, activity, flower-2, lantern). 
   - Place the icon at the top of the card, above the title.
   - Style the icons with EMDRise brand colours (gradient blue→green or primary blue).
5. Content for the 10 cards:

Card 1
Title: Welcome & Introduction
Text: Meet your guide and learn how EMDR helps the brain process stuck memories.

Card 2
Title: Calm Place
Text: Create a personal safe space you can return to at any time during your journey.
